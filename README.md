# 2D Brown Motion
Simulating a 2D Random Walk with Normally Distributed Steps
<br>
<br>

This script generates and visualizes a 2D random walk consisting of 1,000 steps. Starting from the origin, the walker moves in both x and y directions with step sizes drawn from a normal distribution. The resulting path is plotted to illustrate the randomness and dispersion over time, providing a visual representation of a stochastic process.
